# Pollr

This is a full-stack web application created using Node, Express, MongoDB, and React.

### What does it do?

You can view and vote on all the polls created by users. The results of each poll are updated in real-time as people vote. See a poll you want to show other people? You can tweet a link to your followers on Twitter!

If you're signed in, you can create polls of your own and add as many options as you want, as well as delete them if you change your mind.

#### What else do I have to know?
You can see this app running live on https://pollr-chrischavarro.herokuapp.com
